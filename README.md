## Project Overview
Our reefs are facing a growing combination of threats such as climate change, water quality, coastal development, and tourism. A majority of Australia's children do not have sufficient information and awareness about the importance of the preservation of coral reefs. It can be a little dry and distant when kids learn about biomes and ecosystems in school. The main objective of our project is to create an educational website that is interactive and engaging to help children in Australia learn about coral reefs and things they can do on a daily basis to make a difference for the reefs.

## The Team
We are **Reef Rangers**, which is a team of five master's students from different disciplines within the faculty of IT at Monash University. We believe in developing our own strengths to the best of our potential and putting them to good use to accomplish set targets. We aspire to utilise our skill, knowledge, and passion to raise awareness and help Australia's Children to learn about coral reefs.

## Problem Statement
Due to human actions, the planet has lost half of its coral reefs in the past three decades and it is projected that 90% of them might be extinct by 2050. People are the biggest threat to corals due to dredging, destructive fishing practices, recreation misuse, etc. Australia hosts 40% of the coral reefâ€™s population in the Great Barrier Reef, which is critical due to adverse human actions. Due to a lack of information and awareness, we are faced with the problem of preserving the coral reefs and it seems viable to educate and create awareness among the young as they are the future of this society and need to work forward to save the coral reefs.

## Target Audience 
The purpose of the website is to educate **children in the age range of 8-15 years old** about the Great  Barrier Reef and the protection of marine life in Australia. The primary target audience for the website  are young children who have limited knowledge about the great barrier reef. The website is designed in  such a way that parents can also initiate the awareness process in young children.
